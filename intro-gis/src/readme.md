# Introduction to GIS - Shapes and Operations

This directory contains code that is a companion piece to [this]() post on Medium, serving as an introduction to the basic building blocks of geospatial data. I strongly recommend going through these works in tandem as the material covered in both will help inform your knowledge of geospatial data.

I will be using the [shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library for creating the geometric objects. It can be installed by running the command `pip install shapely` in your system terminal. I will also be using [mplleaflet](https://github.com/jwass/mplleaflet) to create interactive maps to display the geometric objects on a basemap to help us get a more intuitive understanding of these objects and their geometries. `mplleaflet` can be installed by running the command `pip install mplleaflet`.
